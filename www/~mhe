In research in mathematics and the theory of computation, what is interesting is
what is incredible but true, defying our intuitions, giving new light
to our understanding. This is of course the case for all sciences, and
for engineering too.  In the theory of higher-type computation, in the
sense of Kleene and Kreisel, my favourite example is the
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0808.0441">characterization</a> of the sets that can be exhaustively searched by an
algorithm, in the sense of Turing, in finite time, as those that are
topologically compact. In particular, this understanding gives
examples of infinite sets that can be completely inspected in finite
time in an algorithmic way, which perhaps defies intuition. <p> I am
also interested in constructive mathematics, which I see as a
generalization, rather than as a restriction, of classical
mathematics. In constructive mathematics, in the way I conceive it,
computation is a side-effect, rather than its foundation. What
distinguishes classical and constructive mathematics is that the
latter is better equipped to explicitly indicate the <em>amount of
information</em> given by its definitions, theorems and proofs, which
is related to topology and domain theory. This is particularly the
case for <a href="https://github.com/michaelt/martin-lof">Martin-L&ouml;f type theory</a>, and even more so for its
univalent extensions, such as Book HoTT
(<a href="https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/">homotopy type
theory</a>)
and <a href="https://github.com/mortberg/cubicaltt">Cubical Type
Theory</a>. Constructivity is not a binary notion, but a matter of
degree. The correct question is not whether a mathematical theorem is constructive, but instead how much information its formulation (type) and proof (inhabitant of the type) give. A good foundation has a rich
supply of types and ways to build their inhabitants so that the
available amount of information can be precisely expressed. <p> The
above is a probably misleading, and certainly incomplete, hint of what
my mathematical and computational
  <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/papers/index.html">research</a> are about.

I joined Birmingham University
in September 2000. My first degree was from the <a href="http://www.ufrgs.br/ufrgs">Universidade
Federal do Rio Grande Sul</a>,
where I also obtained an MSc degree by research. During my undergraduate
and MSc studies, I worked in <a href="http://www.altus.com.br/">industry</a>.
I then went to
<a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College</a>
of the University of London in October 1993 for my PhD under the supervision of <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Smyth:Michael_B=.html">Mike B. Smyth</a>. After completing this in April 1997, I was a
postdoc for one year at Imperial, a lecturer at the <a href="http://www.lfcs.informatics.ed.ac.uk/">University
of Edinburgh</a> for two years, and then at the <a href="http://www.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/">University
of St Andrews</a> for one year, after which I came here and have happily been part of a vibrant theory research group (and department, too!).
